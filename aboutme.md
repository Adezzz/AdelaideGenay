# My story
I was born in France, but spent most of my childhood in China where I lived for over 9 years. I then spent a part of my teenagehood in Brazil (2 years) before returning to France when I was 16. Since then, I've been moving from town to town to pursue my studies in computer science. 

I graduated in  2019  from  the  French  national  engineering school [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr) (Bordeaux),  receiving my computer science degree specialized in multimedia and video game technologies. 

I am now a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria</a> in Bordeaux, directed by <a href="https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/hachet/">Martin Hachet</a> and <a href="https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/">Anatole Lécuyer</a>. My research interests include avatars, augmented reality, and virtual embodiment. I enjoy sharing my research work and participated in numerous pop-science projects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yaLcpMEdnk">Three Minutes Thesis</a>, <a href="https://podcast.ausha.co/these-et-vous/episode-9-informatique-adelaide">Thèse et Vous !</a> podcast, <a href="https://theconversation.com/les-avatars-peuvent-ils-remplacer-notre-corps-164965">The Conversation</a> article, etc.
