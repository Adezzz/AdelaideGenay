### Ph.D.

Oct. 2019 - Oct. 2022  
**Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest**  
Ph.D. in Computer Science (ongoing), supervised by [Martin Hachet](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/hachet/) and [Anatole Lécuyer](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/). I am part of the [Potioc](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/fr/) and [Hybrid](https://team.inria.fr/hybrid/) teams.

**Title**: Design and Evaluation of Avatars for Augmented Reality  

**Research topics:** *HCI, avatars, AR, MR, Sense of Embodiment, Experimental Research*  

**Abstract**: Once reserved for virtual environments, avatars are now increasingly present in Augmented Reality (AR) applications. AR allows to see virtual content directly integrated to the real world. Associated with interaction techniques, it makes it possible to modify the appearance of the user in real time, even replacing their entire body with that of an avatar. This recent possibility opens doors to many uses, but the perception of this "avatarization" is still little known within this context. In this thesis, we explore avatar embodiment in AR through several axes. First, we studied the sense of embodiment of these avatars and the particular factors that impact it in AR. Secondly, we looked at the interaction techniques that allow us to control these avatars in the 3rd person and how they can be used to improve our perception of real-world affordances. Finally, we explored strategies to enhance embodiment illusions in AR by designing transitions to become one's avatar and methods of conditioning the user to prepare them for their avatarization.
