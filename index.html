<p> Welcome to my homepage. If you cannot find the information you're looking for, if you are interested by a research collaboration, or even if you just want to say hi, please feel free to contact me. </p>

<h1> About me </h1>

  <p>I was born in France, but spent most of my childhood in China where I lived for 9 years. I then spent a part of my teenagehood in Brazil (2 years) before returning to France when I was 16 years old. </p>

  <p>Since then, I've been moving from town to town to pursue my studies in computer science. I graduated in 2019 from the French national engineering school <a href="https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/">ENSEIRB-MATMECA</a> (Bordeaux),  receiving my computer science degree specialized in multimedia and video game technologies.</p>

  <p> After that, I conducted a Ph.D. thesis <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria</a> in Bordeaux, directed by <a href="https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/hachet/">Martin Hachet</a> and <a href="https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/">Anatole Lécuyer</a>. My defense was the 13th of December, 2023. My research interests include avatars, augmented reality, and virtual embodiment. I talk about my work in several pop-science projects (in French): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yaLcpMEdnk">Three Minutes Thesis</a>, <a href="https://podcast.ausha.co/these-et-vous/episode-9-informatique-adelaide">Thèse et Vous !</a> podcast, <a href="https://theconversation.com/les-avatars-peuvent-ils-remplacer-notre-corps-164965">The Conversation</a> article, etc.</p>

<h1> Activity </h1>
  
  <p>I am currently looking for a post-doc position in Melbourne. Until I find one, I'm working as a freelance R&D engineer. Please do not hesitate to e-mail me if you're interested in hiring a post-doc with skills in AR/VR, or if you have a dev project that I can help you with.</p>
