<p> Welcome to my homepage. If you are interested in a research collaboration or just want to say hi, please feel free to contact me at adelaide [dot] genay [at] unimelb [dot] edu [dot] au. </p>

<h1> About me </h1>

  <p>I was born in France but spent most of my childhood abroad, including in Shanghai and Sao Paulo I returned to France for higher education and graduated in 2019 from the French national engineering school <a href="https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/">ENSEIRB-MATMECA</a> (Bordeaux), receiving my computer science degree specialized in multimedia and video game technologies.</p>

  <p> After that, I conducted a PhD thesis at the French national institute <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">Inria</a> in Bordeaux, directed by <a href="https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/hachet/">Martin Hachet</a> and <a href="https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/">Anatole Lécuyer</a>. My thesis was focused on designing avatars in AR and studying their user perception.</p>

  <p> Following my PhD defence in 2022, I made a short detour in the industry where I became Lead Research Engineer at a French tech company called  <a href="https://www.co-idea.eu/en/">Co-Idea</a>. Operating as a freelance contractor, I participated in developing an AR educational system (CARDS) designed to foster collaborative learning experiences in classroom settings.</p>

  <p> After a few twists and turns, I then moved to Melbourne (Australia) and started two postdoc positions at the University of Melbourne and Monash University. I explored how to enhance remote collaboration systems in Mixed Reality, facilitating seamless interactions among many users from diverse physical locations. In parallel, I contributed to developing an immersive VR ecosystem simulation tailored to assist stakeholders in formulating policies that positively impact the environment.</p>

<h1> Activity </h1>
  
  <p>I am now a Lecturer in Computer Graphics and Visualisation at the University of Melbourne (Australia), School of Computing and Information Systems. This year, I am teaching  <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2024/subjects/info90003">Designing Novel Interactions</a> and <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2024/subjects/comp30019">Graphics and Interactions</a>. Check out the super cool projects of our students [here](https://www.technologiesforartisticresearch.com.au/showcase-2024) and [here](https://feit-comp30019.github.io/2024s2/#/).</p>
  
  <p>  I am looking for PhD students to supervise. Send me an email if interested in cool immersive tech!</p>
